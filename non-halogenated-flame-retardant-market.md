<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Halogenated Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphorous</li><li>Nitrogenous</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-halogenated flame retardant market comprises three main types: phosphorous, nitrogenous, and other flame retardants. Phosphorous-based flame retardants work by releasing phosphoric acid during combustion, which creates a protective char layer. Nitrogenous flame retardants release nitrogen gas during a fire, diluting the oxygen concentration and reducing the chance of combustion. Other non-halogenated flame retardants include inorganic compounds, metal hydroxides, and intumescent additives, which expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective barrier against flames. These different types of non-halogenated flame retardants offer varying levels of fire resistance and compatibility with different materials.</p></p>
