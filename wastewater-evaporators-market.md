<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wastewater Evaporators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating Evaporators</li><li>Trajectory Evaporators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wastewater evaporators are devices used to treat wastewater by using heat to evaporate the water and leave behind concentrated solids. Floating evaporators are designed to float on the surface of a wastewater pond or tank, and they use heat to evaporate the water. Trajectory evaporators, on the other hand, are mounted on a structure and use a rotating arm to distribute the wastewater over a large surface area. Both types of evaporators help in efficiently treating wastewater and reducing the volume of waste.</p></p>
