<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isolated DC-DC Converter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flyback</li><li>Forward</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Isolated DC-DC converters are electronic devices that convert a direct current (DC) input voltage to a different DC output voltage, while providing electrical isolation between the input and output circuits. Two common types of isolated DC-DC converters are the flyback converter and the forward converter. </p><p>The flyback converter operates by storing energy in the transformer during the switch-on period and releasing it to the output during the switch-off period. This converter is known for its simplicity and low cost. </p><p>On the other hand, the forward converter transfers energy from the input to the output continuously by driving the transformer in a forward manner. It is often preferred for its high efficiency and ability to handle higher power levels compared to the flyback converter.</p></p>
