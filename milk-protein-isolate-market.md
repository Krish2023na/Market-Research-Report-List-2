<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Milk Protein Isolate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casein</li><li>Whey</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Milk protein isolate (MPI) is a popular ingredient found in a variety of food and beverage products. It is obtained through the filtration process of milk, resulting in a high protein content. There are two main types of MPI: casein and whey. Casein is a slow-digesting protein that provides sustained release of amino acids, making it ideal for muscle recovery and growth. Whey, on the other hand, is a fast-digesting protein that is quickly absorbed by the body, making it suitable for post-workout recovery. Both casein and whey protein isolates have their unique benefits and applications in the market.</p></p>
