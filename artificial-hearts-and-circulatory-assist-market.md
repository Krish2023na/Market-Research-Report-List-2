<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Hearts and Circulatory Assist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Devices</li><li>Artificial Heart</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial hearts, also known as total artificial hearts (TAH), are mechanical devices that replace the function of a person's failing heart. These devices are typically used as a temporary solution until a suitable donor heart becomes available for transplantation. On the other hand, circulatory assist devices, such as ventricular assist devices (VAD), are mechanical pumps that help support the weakened heart by assisting with the pumping of blood. VADs can be used as a bridge to transplantation or as a long-term solution for patients who are not eligible for heart transplant. Both artificial hearts and circulatory assist devices play a crucial role in treating heart failure and improving the overall quality of life for patients.</p></p>
