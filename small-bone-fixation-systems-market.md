<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Bone Fixation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Fixation Systems</li><li>Internal Fixation Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small bone fixation systems market includes two main types: external fixation systems and internal fixation systems. External fixation systems involve the use of special devices placed externally on the patient's body to stabilize and hold fractured bones in place. In contrast, internal fixation systems use implants like plates, screws, or rods that are inserted inside the patient's body to maintain bone alignment. Both types of systems are essential in treating small bone fractures, but they differ in their approach and application.</p></p>
