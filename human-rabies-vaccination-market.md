<p><strong>The Human Rabies Vaccination Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-exposure</li><li>Post-exposure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The human rabies vaccination market comprises two main applications: pre-exposure and post-exposure. Pre-exposure vaccination involves administering the vaccine to individuals who are at a higher risk of contracting rabies, such as veterinarians or laboratory workers. This helps build immunity before any potential exposure to the virus occurs. On the other hand, post-exposure vaccination is administered to individuals who have already been exposed to the virus, providing immediate protection against developing rabies. Both applications play a crucial role in preventing and controlling the spread of this deadly disease.</p></p>
