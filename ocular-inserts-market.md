<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ocular Inserts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soluble Inserts</li><li>Insoluble Inserts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ocular inserts are a type of ocular drug delivery system that is placed into the eye to provide sustained release of medication. There are two types of ocular inserts in the market: soluble inserts and insoluble inserts. Soluble inserts dissolve in the tear film, releasing the medication gradually over time. Insoluble inserts, on the other hand, do not dissolve but slowly release the medication through diffusion. Both types of inserts offer controlled drug release, allowing for efficient and convenient treatment of various ocular conditions.</p></p>
