<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hernia Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hernia patch market can be divided into two types: absorbable and non-absorbable patches. Absorbable patches are made from materials that can be broken down and absorbed by the body over time. They provide temporary support to the damaged tissue until it regains strength. Non-absorbable patches, on the other hand, are made from materials that do not break down in the body and remain indefinitely. They provide permanent reinforcement to the weakened area and prevent the hernia from recurring. These different types cater to varying patient needs and preferences in addressing hernia treatment.</p></p>
