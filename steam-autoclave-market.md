<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Autoclave Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-vacuum Autoclave</li><li>Steam Flush Autoclave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Steam Autoclave market consists of two types: Pre-vacuum Autoclave and Steam Flush Autoclave. Pre-vacuum Autoclaves create a vacuum first to remove air from the chamber, ensuring effective sterilization as steam quickly penetrates instruments or objects. Steam Flush Autoclaves, on the other hand, use a pulsing motion of steam to achieve sterilization by maintaining a consistent temperature throughout the chamber. Both types are widely used in medical facilities, laboratories, and other industries where sterilization is essential to prevent the spread of infections.</p></p>
