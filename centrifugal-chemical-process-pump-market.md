<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Chemical Process Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>End Suction</li><li>Back Pull</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal chemical process pumps are categorized into two types: End Suction and Back Pull. In an End Suction pump, the liquid enters through the impeller eye and is discharged radially from the impeller periphery. This design allows for easy installation and maintenance. On the other hand, a Back Pull pump has a unique design that allows for easy removal of the rotating element without disturbing the pump casing or the piping. This design is especially useful when handling corrosive or hazardous fluids, as it minimizes downtime and ensures operator safety.</p></p>
