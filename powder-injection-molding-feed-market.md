<p><strong>The Powder Injection Molding Feed Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>For MIM</li><li>For CIM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Powder Injection Molding (PIM) is a manufacturing technology that is used for producing complex metal or ceramic parts. In the MIM (Metal Injection Molding) market, PIM technology is used exclusively for metal materials. It involves mixing small metal particles with a binder material to form a feedstock, which is then injected into a mold and sintered to obtain the final product. On the other hand, in the CIM (Ceramic Injection Molding) market, PIM technology is used specifically for ceramic materials, where the feedstock consists of ceramic particles mixed with a binder. The subsequent steps are similar to MIM.</p></p>
