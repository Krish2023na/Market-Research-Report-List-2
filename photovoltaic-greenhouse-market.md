<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photovoltaic Greenhouse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Pitche</li><li>Multiple Pitches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photovoltaic greenhouse market consists of two main types: single pitch and multiple pitches. In a single pitch greenhouse, the roof structure slopes only in one direction, providing a uniform angle for solar panel installation. This type is common in regions where sunlight is abundant. On the other hand, multiple pitches greenhouses have roofs with different angles, allowing for optimal panel positioning in areas with varying sunlight exposure. This type is suitable for locations with limited solar resources, maximizing energy capture under different conditions.</p></p>
