<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Plant Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulverized Fuel</li><li>Circulation Fluidized Bed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Power plant boilers are essential components of power generation systems. Pulverized fuel boilers, also known as conventional boilers, burn coal or other solid fuels to produce steam. These boilers ignite the fuel in a combustion chamber and transfer heat to water-filled tubes to generate high-pressure steam. Circulation fluidized bed boilers, on the other hand, use a fluidized bed of sand or limestone to burn coal or biomass. These boilers offer better fuel flexibility, lower emissions, and improved combustion efficiency compared to pulverized fuel boilers.</p></p>
