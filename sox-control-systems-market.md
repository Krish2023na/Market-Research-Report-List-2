<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SOx Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SOx control systems are used to reduce the emission of sulfur oxides (SOx) from industrial processes. Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) reaction involves injecting ammonia or urea into a high-temperature environment to react with nitrogen oxides (NOx), which then reduces the formation of sulfuric acid. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) reaction, on the other hand, uses a catalyst to convert nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides into nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. Both methods are effective in reducing SOx emissions and improving air quality.</p></p>
