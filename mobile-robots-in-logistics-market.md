<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Robots in Logistics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automated Guided Vehicles</li><li>Autonomous Mobile Robots</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are robotics systems used for transporting goods within a controlled environment. They follow pre-defined paths through the help of sensors or markers on the floor. AGVs are commonly used in warehouses, factories, and distribution centers to optimize the movement of materials and increase operational efficiency. On the other hand, Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are self-navigating robots that can move freely and perform various tasks without requiring predefined paths. AMRs are designed to adapt to changing environments and often use advanced technologies like sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate and operate in dynamic logistics settings.</p></p>
