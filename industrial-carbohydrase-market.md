<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Carbohydrase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amylase</li><li>Glucanase</li><li>Cellulase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial carbohydrase market is segmented into three main types: amylase, glucanase, and cellulase. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simple sugars like glucose, maltose, and oligosaccharides. Glucanase aids in the hydrolysis of glucans, which are complex polysaccharides found in plants. Cellulase, on the other hand, breaks down cellulose, the main component of plant cell walls, into glucose. These carbohydrases are crucial in various industries like food and beverages, biofuel production, textile manufacturing, and animal feed.</p></p>
