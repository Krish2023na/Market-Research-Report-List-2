<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mode Locker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mode Locker Market Types can be classified into Active Type and Passive Type. </p><p>Active Type Mode Lockers involve the use of external elements, such as a voltage or current source, to actively control the locking of the laser's modes. This type typically offers greater flexibility and customization options, but it is also more complex and requires additional components for operation.</p><p>Passive Type Mode Lockers, on the other hand, do not require any external elements for mode locking. They rely on the inherent properties of the laser cavity to passively generate mode-locked pulses. This type is generally simpler and more cost-effective, but it may have reduced customization capabilities compared to the active type.</p><p>Overall, the choice between active and passive types depends on the specific requirements, complexity, and budget of the application. Both types serve the purpose of mode locking lasers but differ in their operational approach.</p></p>
