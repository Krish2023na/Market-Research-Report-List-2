<p><strong>The Cepharanthine Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Agranulocytosis</li><li>Leukopenia</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cepharanthine, a natural alkaloid derived from certain plant species, is used in the treatment of two blood disorders: agranulocytosis and leukopenia. Agranulocytosis is a condition characterized by a severe decrease in white blood cells, making patients vulnerable to infections. Cepharanthine helps boost the production of white blood cells, aiding the body's immune response. Similarly, leukopenia denotes low levels of white blood cells, which results in a compromised immune system. Cepharanthine serves as an effective remedy for both conditions, ensuring improved immune function and protection against infections.</p></p>
