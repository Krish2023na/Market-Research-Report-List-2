<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cold Box Resin Casting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phenolic Urethane Cold Box Binder (PUCB)</li><li>Phenollc Ester Cold Box (PECB) Binder</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cold box resin casting refers to the process of creating objects by pouring liquid resin into a mold, which then solidifies at room temperature. The market for cold box resin casting is segmented into three types: Phenolic Urethane Cold Box Binder (PUCB), Phenolic Ester Cold Box (PECB) Binder, and Others. PUCB is a binder made from a mixture of phenolic resin and urethane, offering excellent dimensional stability. PECB binder, on the other hand, uses phenolic resin combined with a different ester, providing improved heat resistance. Lastly, the Others category includes various binders that do not fall into the PUCB or PECB types.</p></p>
