<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PERC Cells Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Side</li><li>Double Side</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact) cells are a type of solar photovoltaic cells that have gained popularity in recent years. In the PERC cells market, there are two types: single side and double side. Single-side PERC cells only have the rear side passivated, while double-side PERC cells have both sides passivated. Single-side PERC cells are easier to manufacture and offer improved efficiency compared to traditional cells. On the other hand, double-side PERC cells have higher efficiency potential due to their ability to absorb light from both sides, resulting in increased energy generation.</p></p>
