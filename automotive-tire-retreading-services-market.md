<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tire Retreading Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-cure</li><li>Mold-cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive tire retreading services market consists of two types: pre-cure and mold-cure. In pre-cure retreading, a new tread is applied to a used tire by using a pre-cured tread strip that is bonded to the tire casing. This process is done using specialized equipment and materials. On the other hand, mold-cure retreading involves replacing the original tread with a new one by placing the tire in a mold and injecting a new rubber compound, which is cured under high heat and pressure. Both methods contribute to extending the life of tires, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability in the automotive industry.</p></p>
